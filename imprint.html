                <h2>EU Online Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>
                    The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (OS):
                    <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>
                </p>

                <p>Our email address can be found in this imprint.</p>

                <h2>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>We are not obliged to participate in alternative dispute resolution procedures before a consumer arbitration board.</p>

                <h2>Liability for Contents</h2>
                <p>
                    As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to general laws. We are not
                    obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
                    activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability
                    in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we
                    become aware of any such infringements, we will remove the relevant content immediately.
                </p>

                <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
                <p>
                    Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we
                    cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always
                    responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the
                    time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the
                    contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware
                    of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
                </p>

                <h2>Copyright</h2>
                <p>
                    The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to Austrian copyright law. Duplication,
                    processing, distribution, or any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the copyright law shall
                    require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only
                    permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the
                    copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you become aware
                    of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such
                    contents immediately.
                </p>
